    "This ensures that the attention mechanism’s current decision (choosing where to attend next) is informed by a reminder of its previous decisions (summarized in $c^t$). This should make it easier for the attention mechanism to avoid repeatedly attending to the same locations, and thus avoid generating repetitive text.\n",
